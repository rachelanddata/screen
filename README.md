# TODO
- Dockerize MySQL & Debian images w/ Docker Compose
- Source data requires more profiling (code as is will not process all files)

# STEPS
- Build the docker image
- Run: 
```
docker run --rm -it ${whatever-you-named-the-image} /bin/bash
apt install mysql-server
/etc/init.d/mysql start

mysql -p 
CREATE DATABASE INTERVIEW;
python2.7 main.py
```
- 
# Instructions

- Build this docker image
- You can run `bash` as the command with an interactive tty to get into the image:

```
docker run --rm -it ${whatever-you-named-the-image} /bin/bash
```

- Setup a local database within the docker image.
- Load the csv files from the `data` directory into the database you created.
- Answer the questions [below](README.md#Questions) and output the answers into an answer table(s).
- Lastly, create a Pull Request with your code for review
